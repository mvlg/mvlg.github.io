## About Me

---

I am a historian of art and science with a focus on modern Germany. My work deals with the interconnected histories of aesthetics, anthropology, and the life sciences. I am particularly interested in the ways that images shape and disrupt our understanding of what it means to be human. 

Since 2018 I have been a research associate at the [Warburg Institute](https://warburg.sas.ac.uk), University of London, where I am a member of the [Bilderfahrzeuge](https://bilderfahrzeuge.hypotheses.org) project. Here you can see some of my [publications](/publications).

I am currently at work on two major projects. My first book manuscript, **The Science of Expression: Nature, Culture and Gesture in Modern Germany**, tells the story of how gesture became the object of scientific knowledge in early twentieth-century Germany. Through a series of interdisciplinary encounters, it narrates how art historians, philosophers, biologists, psychologists and filmmakers worked together to construct an alternative epistemology of somatic expression, a phenomenon that then as now unsettles distinctions between the natural and the human sciences.

My current project reconstructs the first exhibition of global art history in Germany, organized by the historian Karl Lamprecht in 1914. Entitled **In the Hall of Culture. Global Art History in the Deep Time of Empire**, the book situates this exhibition within the wider context of historical scholarship, scientific racism and imperial *Kulturpolitik* at the eve of the First World War, and offers critical new perspectives on the global turn in art history today.

This year I am co-convening the working group on [Colonial Science in the German Empire at the Consortium for Science, Technology and Medicine](https://www.chstm.org/content/colonial-science-german-empire-0).

I hold a PhD in German from Princeton University. I was born in California.
