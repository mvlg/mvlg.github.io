## About Me

I am a historian of art and science with a focus on modern Germany. Broadly speaking, my research deals with the ways that images shape and disrupt the conceptual divide between nature and culture. I take an interdisciplinary approach that attends to the interwoven histories of aesthetics, anthropology, psychology and the life sciences. 

Since 2018 I have been a research associate at the Warburg Institute, where I am a member of the Bilderfahrzeuge project.My first book manuscript, **The Science of Expression: Nature, Culture and Gesture in Modern Germany**, tells the story of how gesture became the object of scientific knowledge in early twentieth-century Germany. In it, I reveal how art historians, philosophers, biologists, psychologists and filmmakers collaborated to devise an alternative epistemology of somatic expression, a phenomenon that then as now unsettles distinctions between the natural and the human sciences. 

My current project reconstructs the first exhibition of global art history in Germany, organized by the historian Karl Lamprecht in 1914. Entitled **In the Hall of Culture. Global Art History in the Deep Time of Empire**, the book situates this exhibition within the wider context of historical scholarship, scientific racism and imperial Kulturpolitik at the eve of the First World War, and offers critical new perspectives on the global turn in art history today.

This year I co-convene the working group on [Colonial Science in the German Empire at the Consortium for Science, Technology and Medicine](https://www.chstm.org/content/colonial-science-german-empire-0).I hold a PhD in German from Princeton University. I was born in California.
